* THE most realistic car simulator ever made


Overview:
+ WASD to move (no rotation yet, we're getting to it)
+ The "SPEED" number is 100s of pixels per second

+ Feel free to configure the size, but do not change the +164.
    - also keep it square

Challenge:
- Max out the top bar
- Get 30 SPEED







also just in case you didn't get it, line one was a joke^[citation]
